I haven\u2019t spoken to these SleazeBags in years, they don\u2019t want the facts, and they\u2019re so inaccurate (purposely!) about everything. I would have thought Forbes would be DEAD by now, but it continues to hang around like a bad disease. Isn\u2019t it owned by a hostile nation? Anyway, that\u2019s what happens when you have bad reporters with evil intentions. Eventually the publication dies. I\u2019ve happily seen it over, and over, again!",

The Democrats would LOVE to see the Biggest Tax Hike in History (68%!), No Border Spending (Open Borders!), and a weak, underfunded Military, so we wouldn\u2019t be able to do things like we did just one week ago in Iran. We gave the Dems a Debt Extension because it was the right thing to do, but they won\u2019t do it for us. The one thing they do have is an ability to stick together, and vote as one group (They don\u2019t have GRANDSTANDERS!). They also have House and Senate Rules that give Great Power to their Leaders - Committee Chairmanships, etc. Republicans don\u2019t have that, have never been able to get it, BUT THEY SHOULD!

At the same time, he is unable to understand the importance of a Debt Extension, which Republicans gave to the Democrats just prior to the November 5th Election, because of its significance, and how important it was for the future of the U.S.A. Sadly, the Democrat Politicians probably won\u2019t reciprocate on a Debt Extension because they\u2019re nasty people who actually hate our Country. Tillis is also willing to throw the very important Tobacco Industry in North Carolina, \u201cout the window,\u201d for reasons nobody seems to understand. He loves China made windmills that will cost a fortune, ruin the landscape, and produce the most expensive Energy on Earth. I can\u2019t believe that the Great People of North Carolina, a State that I love and won all three times, and a State that I just brought back with money, blood, sweat, and tears, from the recent tragic floods, when Sleepy Joe Biden let them DROWN, right up until the end of that Administration, without doing anything \u2014 I was given an A+ Rating for the job we did in bringing it back, and Tillis, despite being a Republican, was MISSING IN ACTION \u2014 North Carolina will not allow one of their Senators to GRANDSTAND in order to get some publicity for himself, for a possible, but very difficult Re-Election. America wants Reduced Taxes, including NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, AND NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY, Interest Deductions on Cars, Border Security, a Strong Military, and a Bill which is GREAT for our Farmers, Manufacturers and, Employment, in general. Thom Tillis is making a BIG MISTAKE for America, and the Wonderful People of North Carolina!",

He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran. Importantly, he is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING (Cigars, Bugs Bunny Doll, etc.). It is a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure. This travesty of \u201cJustice\u201d will interfere with both Iran and Hamas negotiations. In other words, it is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu. The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm \u2014 And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE\u2019S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!",

    "content": "BREAKING NEWS\u2026I was shocked to hear that the State of Israel, which has just had one of its Greatest Moments in History, and is strongly led by Bibi Netanyahu, is continuing its ridiculous Witch Hunt against their Great War Time Prime Minister! Bibi and I just went through HELL together, fighting a very tough and brilliant longtime enemy of Israel, Iran, and Bibi could not have been better, sharper, or stronger in his LOVE for the incredible Holy Land. Anybody else would have suffered losses, embarrassment, and chaos! Bibi Netanyahu was a WARRIOR, like perhaps no other Warrior in the History of Israel, and the result was something that nobody thought was possible, a complete elimination of potentially one of the biggest and most powerful Nuclear Weapons anywhere in the World, and it was going to happen, SOON! We were fighting, literally, for the Survival of Israel, and there is nobody in Israel\u2019s History that fought harder or more competently than Bibi Netanyahu. Despite all of this, I just learned that Bibi has been summoned to Court on Monday for the continuation of this long running, (He has been going through this \u201cHorror Show\u201d since May of 2020 \u2013 Unheard of! This is the first time a sitting Israeli Prime Minister has ever been on trial.), politically motivated case, \u201cconcerning cigars, a Bugs Bunny doll, and numerous other unfair charges\u201d in order to do him great harm. Such a WITCH HUNT, for a man who has given so much, is unthinkable to me. He deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu\u2019s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero, who has done so much for the State. Perhaps there is no one that I know who could have worked in better harmony with the President of the United States, ME, than Bibi Netanyahu. It was the United States of America that saved Israel, and now it is going to be the United States of America that saves Bibi Netanyahu. THIS TRAVESTY OF \u201cJUSTICE\u201d CAN NOT BE ALLOWED!",

The Democrats aren\u2019t used to WINNING, and she can\u2019t stand the concept of our Country being successful again. When we examine her Test Scores, we will find out that she is NOT qualified for office but, nevertheless, far more qualified than Crockett, who is a seriously Low IQ individual, or Ilhan Omar, who does nothing but complain about our Country, yet the Failed Country that she comes from doesn\u2019t have a Government, is drenched in Crime and Poverty, and is rated one of the WORST in the World, if it\u2019s even rated at all. How dare \u201cThe Mouse\u201d tells us how to run the United States of America! We\u2019re just now coming back from that Radical Left experiment with Sleepy Joe, Kamala, and \u201cTHE AUTOPEN,\u201d in charge. What a disaster it was! AOC should be forced to take the Cognitive Test that I just completed at Walter Reed Medical Center, as part of my Physical. As the Doctor in charge said, \u201cPresident Trump ACED it,\u201d meaning, I got every answer right. Instead of her constant complaining, Alexandria should go back home to Queens, where I was also brought up, and straighten out her filthy, disgusting, crime ridden streets, in the District she \u201crepresents,\u201d and which she never goes to anymore. She better start worrying about her own Primary, before she thinks about beating our Great Palestinian Senator, Cryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer, whose career is definitely on very thin ice! She and her Democrat friends have just hit the Lowest Poll Numbers in Congressional History, so go ahead and try Impeaching me, again, MAKE MY DAY!",

Only the Fake News would say anything different in order to try and demean, as much as possible \u2014 And even they say they were \u201cpretty well destroyed!\u201d Working especially hard on this falsehood is Allison Cooper of Fake News CNN, Dumb Brian L. Roberts, Chairman of \u201cCon\u201dcast, Jonny Karl of ABC Fake News, and always, the Losers of, again, Concast\u2019s NBC Fake News. It never ends with the sleazebags in the Media, and that\u2019s why their Ratings are at an ALL TIME LOW \u2014 ZERO CREDIBILITY!",

    "content": "Did I hear Former President Medvedev, from Russia, casually throwing around the \u201cN word\u201d (Nuclear!), and saying that he and other Countries would supply Nuclear Warheads to Iran? Did he really say that or, is it just a figment of my imagination? If he did say that, and, if confirmed, please let me know, IMMEDIATELY. The \u201cN word\u201d should not be treated so casually. I guess that\u2019s why Putin\u2019s \u201cTHE BOSS.\u201d By the way, if anyone thinks our \u201chardware\u201d was great over the weekend, far and away the strongest and best equipment we have, 20 years advanced over the pack, is our Nuclear Submarines. They are the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built, and just launched the 30 Tomahawks \u2014 All 30 hit their mark perfectly. So, in addition to our Great Fighter Pilots, thank you to the Captain and Crew!",
